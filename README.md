A dream society. Why is life so hard?

In 2022, social problems still exist and haven't been solved properly. We still suffer from poverty and crime. Life is unpleasant and doesn't pay for the vast majority of workers. Workers are underpaid and still suffer a lack of wage inflation. Work doesn't pay unless you're a software developer.

By the same token businesses are really difficult to start and cost a lot of money in legal and debt costs. The barriers to entry are enormous. Most businesses fail and nobody seems to care.

When you bake a cake, you cannot get the egg back out.

Coordination is rare.

Everything is irreversible and difficult. To start an endeavour you suddenly have lots of problems to solve. You have lots of decisions to make.

House prices are too expensive. Nobody young can afford a house. People have to compete for shelter in the same way animals compete for shelter. Economic growth is severely limited when people have to compete for basic needs like shelter. People need to depend on their families for simple basic needs such as shelter.

Inflation is far higher than reported because governments don't track inflation of what the average person needs to spend on.

# Safety network

Businesses should always succeed. I propose outsourcing be how we create a safer society. Establish government backed business administration centres which handle administration for businesses. It should be easy to start a company. 

People who want to be protected: put in a database, when job is lost, database kicks in.

# Beyond Authoritarianism

Authoritarianism is necessary for certain jobs that require things be done a certain way :- running a farm for example. Fast food restaurants.

Can we go beyond authoritarianism for doing things?

# Everyone has housing (shelter)

# Gig economy is not suffering inducing

# Luxury pod apartments for everyone

Luxury pod apartments become the standard mode of living. A luxury pod apartment has the following:
* a gym
* an indoor swimming pool
* communal restaurants
* communal kitchens
* bakery
* pod-like rooms with en suite and a bed
* community lounges with stocked food and drinks (a bit like hotel executive lounges)
* private rooms with sofas

# People living off marketing and rewards

# Studying Suffering as a science

Find all the things that cause people to suffer then eradicate them one by one.

# Buildings designed to feed people

A building that can cook food centrally and distribute it to a eating area.

# Country is appetising for business

* maternity leave pay, sick leave pay come out of government printed money

# Hard work should pay more money

Some jobs take more calories than others. Let's pay people based on the calories used by the job.
